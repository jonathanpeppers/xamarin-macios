        family, a socket type and a protocol.</summary>
        <remarks>
          <para>
	    Use this method when you need more control over the type
	    of connection that you need.   Unlike the other methods in
	    CFStream which default to TCP/IP streams (which sets protocol to
	    Internet, socket type to stream and protocol to TCP) with
	    this method you can specify those parameter individually.
